# Photoelasticity tools for granular matter (and beyond?)

We are a team of physicists and engineers, working together to provide open-source tools for analyzing photoelastic images of granular materials.

## Packages

* PEGS-1.0: This is a fork from <https://github.com/jekollmer/PEGS>
* PEGS-2.0: <https://github.com/photoelasticity/PeGS2> contains a modularized version which is more convenient to use and adapt, along with some new features.
